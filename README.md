# Infectious Disease Dynamics - Antibiotic Resistance and Vaccination Trade-offs

This repository was created in the context of a lab rotation at the [theoretical biology group](https://tb.ethz.ch/) of Prof Sebastian Bonhoeffer at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html).

A common concept in evolutionary theory is the [virulence transmission trade-off](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6177/1243727). As in the case for HIV-1 in this paper we hypothesis that the same concept applies as well to antibiotic resistance and vaccination. Antibiotic resistance is a cost for the bacterium, resulting in a reduce fitness. We hypothesise that the introduction of vaccination and thus the rise in immune patients will result in a shortage of available hosts and thus in a shift to lower virulence in order to maximise transmission. 

This hypothesis will be simulated using an epidemiological model.
